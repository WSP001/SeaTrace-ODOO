### Pillar Details

#### 🌊 **1. SeaSide (HOLD)** - Vessel Operations | PUBLIC KEY 🔓
**Function:** F/V MASTER AIS overlay tracking vessels at THREE CRITICAL TRIP MOMENTS

**🚨 THE STARTING POINT for all SeaTrace data flows**

SeaSide is NOT about "catch recording" (that's DeckSide's job). This module creates the **foundation packets** from IoT sensor data captured at sea, using **NGO/Global Fishing Watch API integration** for vessel identity verification and behavior analysis.

**Three Key Trip Moments (F/V MASTER AIS Overlay):**
1. **BEFORE LEAVING:** Vessel position verification at dock, trip initialization, IoT sensor calibration
2. **ON THE WAY BACK:** Return voyage tracking, approximate position PING events (FAO zone level)
3. **ARRIVING AT PORT:** Final approach monitoring, landing preparation, packet finalization

**Microservice Capabilities:**

**NGO/GFW API v3 Integration:**
- **Vessel Search:** Identity verification via IMO numbers, vessel name matching
- **Position Tracking:** AIS data ingestion with gap detection (flags >4 hour reporting gaps as suspicious)
- **Fishing Events:** Port visits, fishing activity, encounters with other vessels
- **Behavior Analysis:** Tracks fishing hours, protected area violations, suspicious patterns
- **Rate Limiting:** Async client with 10 concurrent requests max, 100ms intervals, 429 retry handling

**Packet Creation Workflow:**
```
IoT Sensors → Data Aggregation → GFW Enrichment → Packet Assembly → DeckSide Routing
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- `GFWIntegrator` async client (Python aiohttp) with asyncio.Semaphore rate limiting
- `NGOAgent` handles data access requests, compliance checks, trust scores
- Vessel size categorization: SMALL (<15 MT) vs LARGE (≥15 MT) determines regulatory requirements
- Prometheus metrics: GFW_REQUEST_COUNT, GFW_ERROR_COUNT, GFW_REQUEST_DURATION

**ODOO Integration:** Account module for vessel operational costs and crew payroll

**Commons Good Commitment:** ✅ FREE forever - Transparent vessel operations

**PUBLIC Data Exposed (F/V MASTER):**
- **Approximate GPS:** FAO zone level only (e.g., "FAO Zone 77 - Georges Bank")
- **Trip Metadata:** Start/end times, vessel IMO numbers, basic IoT sensor readings (temperature, salinity)
- **Public PING Events:** Timestamped position reports at zone level
- **Species Estimates:** Visual identification (e.g., "Atlantic Cod") WITHOUT precise counts

**PRIVATE Data Hidden ($CHECK KEY):**
- Precise 6-decimal GPS coordinates ("honey holes")
- Exact fish counts and weight measurements
- ML quality predictions and prospectus pricing
- Proprietary fishing pattern analytics

---

#### � **2. DeckSide (RECORD)** - THE CRITICAL FORK | DUAL KEY 🔓🔐
**Function:** Catch verification and the PUBLIC/PRIVATE data split point

**🚨 THIS IS WHERE THE FORK HAPPENS:**

DeckSide is the **central innovation** ($4.2M → $10M+ valuation driver) where catch data splits into two parallel streams:

**PUBLIC STREAM - #CATCH KEY (Commons Good)** 🔓
- **Estimated Weight:** Deckhand tally with ~5-10% margin of error
- **Basic Species ID:** Visual identification (e.g., "Atlantic Cod")
- **Approximate Count:** Estimated fish count for SIMP compliance
- **Simple Grading:** Pass/Fail or basic A/B/C visual grades

**PRIVATE STREAM - $CHECK KEY (Investor Value)** 🔐
- **Prospectus Pricing:** ML-powered valuation (e.g., $25,400 catch prospectus)
- **Exact Count:** Precise fish-by-fish counting (e.g., 392 fish vs. ~400)
- **ML Quality Scores:** 94.2% Grade A confidence predictions
- **ROI Analytics:** 70.1% return potential calculations
- **Precise GPS:** 6-decimal fishing "honey holes" (F/V CAPTAIN coordinates)

**Packet Switching Handler:**
- Validates incoming catch packets from SeaSide
- Transforms data through PUBLIC (#CATCH) and PRIVATE ($CHECK) pipelines
- Routes approximate data to PUBLIC APIs, precise data to PRIVATE dashboards

**ODOO Integration:** Stock Account module with dual valuation layers

**Commons Good Commitment:** ✅ PUBLIC #CATCH KEY FREE forever | 💰 PRIVATE $CHECK KEY monetized

---

#### 🏭 **3. DockSide (STORE)** - Storage Operations | DUAL KEY 🔓🔐
**Function:** Landing reconciliation and cold chain verification with advanced analytics

**🚨 WHERE ESTIMATES MEET REALITY + ECONOMIES OF SCALE**

DockSide is where the **#CATCH KEY estimated data** from DeckSide gets reconciled against **actual landed weights** and cold storage realities. This module validates that what was reported at sea matches what physically arrived at the dock.

**THIS IS THE SECOND FORK** - DockSide splits into PUBLIC compliance tracking vs. PRIVATE inventory optimization and predictive analytics.

**Landing Reconciliation Workflow:**
```
DeckSide PUBLIC Packet (~1200 lbs estimated)
       ↓
Vessel Arrival at Port
       ↓
Physical Unloading & Weighing (actual: 1,180 lbs)
       ↓
Variance Analysis (-20 lbs, -1.67% acceptable)
       ↓
Blockchain Anchoring (immutable verified record)
       ↓
Storage Assignment (cold chain tracking begins)
```

**Microservice Capabilities:**

**PUBLIC STREAM - #STORE KEY (Commons Good)** 🔓

**Landing Records Management:**
- **Arrival Verification:** Match vessel IMO from SeaSide F/V MASTER PING with physical dock arrival
- **Unloading Documentation:** Bill of lading, customs declarations, inspector sign-offs
- **Weight Reconciliation:** Compare DeckSide #CATCH estimates with certified scale readings
- **Variance Thresholds:** Flag catches with >5% weight variance for audit review

**Storage Assignment Logic:**
- **Species-Based Zoning:** Segregate high-value species (tuna, swordfish) from commodity species (cod, haddock)
- **Temperature Requirements:** -20°C for long-term frozen, -2°C to +2°C for fresh/chilled
- **Grade Segregation:** Keep Grade A separate from Grade B/C to prevent cross-contamination perception
- **FIFO Tracking:** First-in-first-out inventory management for perishable goods

**Cold Chain Monitoring:**
- **IoT Sensor Network:** Temperature, humidity, door open/close events every 5 minutes
- **Alert Thresholds:** Immediate alert if temperature deviates ±2°C from target for >15 minutes
- **Blockchain Anchoring:** Hourly temperature snapshots written to immutable audit trail
- **Compliance Reporting:** Automated HACCP logs for regulatory inspections

**Quality Verification:**
- **Visual Inspection:** Final grading to confirm/adjust DeckSide visual classifications
- **Lab Testing:** Random sampling for species DNA verification (prevent fraud/mislabeling)
- **Defect Documentation:** Photo evidence of damage, spoilage, or quality issues
- **Grade Adjustment:** Downgrade catches that deteriorated during transport

**This is a PUBLIC repository** containing only generic, open-source patterns. It is completely separate from:

**Security Guarantees:**
- ✅ No private keys or secrets committed
- ✅ No proprietary algorithms from private repos
- ✅ No customer data or sensitive information
- ✅ Regular separation audits (see `scripts/audit-separation.ps1`)

**For security audit results, see:** [REPO_SEPARATION_AUDIT.md](../REPO_SEPARATION_AUDIT.md)

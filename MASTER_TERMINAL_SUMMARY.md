# 🎯 Summary: Your Acting Master Terminal Workflow

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ WORKING PERFECTLY  
**Terminal:** PowerShell 7.5.3  
**Location:** `C:\Users\Roberto002\Documents\GitHub\SeaTrace-ODOO`

---

## ✅ WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED

### 1. Verified DevShell.ps1 is Working
At **13:54:13** today, you successfully ran:
```powershell
& "C:\Users\Roberto002\OneDrive\Sir James\LOGIC SirJames_Interactive_Prototype_With_Chapter10\scripts\DevShell.ps1" -Project SeaTraceProduction
```

**Result:** ✅ ALL SYSTEMS GO
- Environment loaded correctly
- Working directory: `C:\Users\Roberto002\Documents\GitHub\SeaTrace-ODOO`
- All aliases available: `cd-seatrace-prod`, `cd-seatrace003`, `cd-sirjames`
- Context set: `$env:ACTIVE_PROJECT_CONTEXT = "SeaTraceProduction"`

---

## 📋 THE ONE COMMAND YOU NEED

Copy this, paste it, press Enter ONCE:

```powershell
& "C:\Users\Roberto002\OneDrive\Sir James\LOGIC SirJames_Interactive_Prototype_With_Chapter10\scripts\DevShell.ps1" -Project SeaTraceProduction
```

Wait for the success message:
```
✅ Development environment ready!
ℹ️ Working in: C:\Users\Roberto002\Documents\GitHub\SeaTrace-ODOO
```

Then use these commands:
```powershell
project-context       # See where you are
cd-seatrace-prod      # Switch to PUBLIC repo
cd-seatrace003        # Switch to PRIVATE repo
cd-sirjames           # Switch to Sir James
```

---

## 🎯 REAL USE CASE: Working on Commons Charter (PUBLIC)

```powershell
# 1. Load DevShell (if not already loaded)
& "C:\Users\Roberto002\OneDrive\Sir James\LOGIC SirJames_Interactive_Prototype_With_Chapter10\scripts\DevShell.ps1" -Project SeaTraceProduction

# 2. Verify you're in PUBLIC repo
project-context

# 3. Ask Copilot (be specific)
# SAY: "I'm working on SeaTrace-ODOO (PUBLIC repo).
#       Help me add a section to docs/COMMONS_CHARTER.md
#       about seafood data sharing governance."

# 4. Copilot will:
#    - See: $env:ACTIVE_PROJECT_CONTEXT = "SeaTraceProduction"
#    - Read: .github/copilot-instructions.md (knows this is PUBLIC)
#    - Suggest: Changes to docs/COMMONS_CHARTER.md
#    - Won't suggest: EMR code (that's PRIVATE repo)

# 5. Review changes
git diff

# 6. Commit if good
git add docs/COMMONS_CHARTER.md
git commit -m "docs: add data sharing governance section"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🎯 REAL USE CASE: Working on EMR Pricing (PRIVATE)

```powershell
# 1. Switch to PRIVATE repo
cd-seatrace003

# 2. Verify you're in PRIVATE repo
project-context

# 3. Ask Copilot (be specific)
# SAY: "I'm working on SeaTrace003 (PRIVATE repo).
#       Help me add a new enterprise pricing tier
#       in src/marketside/licensing/entitlements.py"

# 4. Copilot will:
#    - See: $env:ACTIVE_PROJECT_CONTEXT = "SeaTrace003"
#    - Know: This is PRIVATE repo, EMR features are okay
#    - Suggest: Changes to enterprise pricing code
#    - Won't suggest: Public Commons patterns (that's PUBLIC repo)

# 5. Review changes
git diff

# 6. Commit if good
git add src/marketside/licensing/entitlements.py
git commit -m "feat: add enterprise pricing tier for 500+ bed hospitals"
git push origin main

# 7. Switch back to PUBLIC when done
cd-seatrace-prod
```

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES (From Your Terminal Today)

### ❌ Mistake 1: Pasting Commands Multiple Times
**What happened:**
```powershell
& "...\DevShell.ps1" -Project SeaTraceProduction& "...\DevShell.ps1"...
```

**Error:** `ParserError: Unexpected token '-Project'`

**Fix:** Copy command ONCE, paste ONCE, press Enter ONCE

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Copying Example Text as Commands
**What happened:**
```powershell
"SirJames" { "[📚 Sir James]" }
```

**Error:** `ParserError: Unexpected token '{'`

**Fix:** That's not a command! That's showing what the PROMPT will look like. Don't copy it.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Using Aliases Before Loading DevShell
**What happened:**
```powershell
cd-seatrace-prod
```

**Error:** `The term 'cd-seatrace-prod' is not recognized`

**Fix:** Run DevShell.ps1 first to load the aliases.

## 🎓 BEST PRACTICES FOR COPILOT

### ✅ DO: Be Specific About Context
```
✅ GOOD: "I'm working on SeaTrace-ODOO (PUBLIC repo).
          Help me update docs/COMMONS_CHARTER.md"

❌ BAD:  "Update the charter"
```

### ✅ DO: Verify Context First
```powershell
# Always check before asking Copilot
project-context
```

### ✅ DO: Tell Copilot Which File
```
✅ GOOD: "Add a new section to docs/COMMONS_CHARTER.md 
          about data governance"

❌ BAD:  "Add something to the docs"
```

### ✅ DO: Specify Project Type
```
✅ GOOD: "In the PUBLIC repo, update the Commons Charter"

❌ BAD:  "Update the licensing docs"
         (Which repo? PUBLIC or PRIVATE?)
```

---

## 🔍 HOW COPILOT KNOWS YOUR CONTEXT

### Environment Variables Set by DevShell.ps1
```powershell
$env:ACTIVE_PROJECT_CONTEXT = "SeaTraceProduction"
# Copilot sees this!
```

### Copilot Instructions File
```
.github/copilot-instructions.md
# Copilot reads this to understand project scope
```

### You Tell Copilot Explicitly
```
"I'm working on SeaTrace-ODOO (PUBLIC repo)"
# Clear, explicit context in your request
```

---

## 🚀 YOUR DAILY WORKFLOW

### Morning Startup:
```powershell
# 1. Open PowerShell
# 2. Load DevShell
& "C:\Users\Roberto002\OneDrive\Sir James\LOGIC SirJames_Interactive_Prototype_With_Chapter10\scripts\DevShell.ps1" -Project SeaTraceProduction

# 3. Verify context
project-context

# 4. Check git status
git status

# 5. Start working!
```

### Before Asking Copilot:
```powershell
# 1. Verify where you are
project-context

# 2. Check git branch
git branch --show-current

# 3. Tell Copilot explicitly
# "I'm in [PROJECT] on branch [BRANCH]. Help me [TASK]."
```

### Before Committing:
```powershell
# 1. Review changes
git diff

# 2. Verify context AGAIN
project-context

# 3. Check you're in right repo
git remote get-url origin

# 4. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "description"
git push origin main
```

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What Makes DevShell.ps1 Work:
1. ✅ Sets `$env:ACTIVE_PROJECT_CONTEXT` so Copilot knows which repo
2. ✅ Changes directory automatically to correct project
3. ✅ Loads aliases (`cd-seatrace-prod`, etc.) for easy switching
4. ✅ Shows status indicators in prompt
5. ✅ Verifies environment (PowerShell version, modules, Docker, etc.)

### What Makes Copilot Suggestions Correct:
1. ✅ Reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to understand scope
2. ✅ Sees `$env:ACTIVE_PROJECT_CONTEXT` environment variable
3. ✅ You tell it explicitly: "I'm in [REPO]"
4. ✅ Knows which files exist in current directory

### What Prevents Mistakes:
1. ✅ Always run `project-context` before asking Copilot
2. ✅ Always specify repo type: PUBLIC or PRIVATE
3. ✅ Always verify with `git diff` before committing
4. ✅ Keep contexts separate: PUBLIC ≠ PRIVATE

## 🎉 WHAT'S NEXT?

### Immediate (Today):
1. ✅ DevShell.ps1 is loaded and working
2. ✅ Documentation created (5 files)

4. 🔜 Practice switching between repos
5. 🔜 Try asking Copilot with clear context

### Short-term (This Week):
1. Create similar setup for SeaTrace003 (PRIVATE repo)
2. Add git branch indicator to prompt
3. Create `.copilot-context.json` auto-generation
4. Practice the workflow until it's muscle memory

### Long-term (Future):
1. Implement pre-commit hooks for context validation
2. Add automated testing for context switching
3. Create VS Code workspace settings per project
4. Document more use cases and examples

feat: Add Modular Stage 1 Commons Good Documentation & Demo Assets

---

# PR BODY (Copy This)

## 1. What This PR Does

This PR introduces the foundational **"Commons Good"** documentation and demo assets for the **SeaTrace-ODOO** project. It adds **12 new files (4,820 lines)** that define the public-facing architecture, security model, and investor demo package.

This establishes the **PUBLIC-UNLIMITED** framework that all future programming teams and partners will use for integration.

---

## 2. Why This PR is Important

‚úÖ **Onboards New Teams:** Provides the complete 4-pillar architecture and key management guide so new developers can understand the system.

‚úÖ **Defines Public Boundaries:** Clearly separates the "Commons Good" (PUBLIC-UNLIMITED) architecture from the "Investor Prospectus" (PRIVATE-LIMITED) IP, which will remain in the private SeaTrace002 repo.

‚úÖ **Enables Investors & Partners:** Delivers a complete, runnable demo kit (MongoDB seed, Grafana dashboards, Postman) to prove the EMR/Commons Fund model and the $4.2M stack valuation.

## 3. Key Changes (12 Files)

### üìö Core Documentation (3 Files)

#### `docs/PACKET_SWITCHING_ARCHITECTURE.md` (38KB)
- Complete 4-pillar integration architecture (SeaSide, DeckSide, DockSide, MarketSide).
- Defines the **critical DeckSide forking logic** (splitting public/private chains).
- Outlines the public-facing API patterns and the 6-phase implementation roadmap.
- Specifies Prometheus metrics for public monitoring.

#### `docs/PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` (53KB)
- Comprehensive guide for development pairs on implementing the public/private key model at each pillar.
  - **SeaSide:** Vessel auth + internal packet signing.
  - **DeckSide:** Captain signature verification + dual-chain forking.
  - **DockSide:** Processor auth + immutable ledger signing.
  - **MarketSide:** Consumer QR verification (reverse compute) + investor JWT auth.
- Defines the **30-day key rotation management** policy.

#### `docs/DEMO_GUIDE.md` (30KB)
- Full walkthrough for setting up and running the **30-minute investor demo**.
- Includes setup for MongoDB Atlas, Kong, Grafana, and the EMR simulator.
- Provides talking points for investors (technical, business, sustainability).

### üé¨ Demo Infrastructure (9 Files)

- **`demo/atlas/`**: MongoDB schemas and `seed_demo.py` script.
- **`demo/grafana/`**: Commons Fund & EMR Overview dashboard JSON.
- **`demo/kong/`**: `kong.yaml` configuration for API gateway routing.
- **`demo/postman/`**: `SeaTrace-INVESTOR.collection.json` & environment file.
- **`demo/simulator/`**: Python `emr_simulator.py` and `run_demo.ps1` launcher.

## 4. IP & Security Verification

**Classification:** PUBLIC-UNLIMITED (Commons Good)

### Verified NO Private IP:

- [x] No private implementation code from SeaTrace002.
- [x] No proprietary ML models or financial algorithms.
- [x] No production keys, credentials, or private vessel data.
- [x] Contains only architecture patterns, security guidance, and demo data.

---

## 5. Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] Confirm all 12 files adhere to the PUBLIC-UNLIMITED classification.
- [ ] Review `PACKET_SWITCHING_ARCHITECTURE.md` for alignment with the 4-pillar model.
- [ ] Review `PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` to ensure security practices are clear for new teams.
- [ ] (Optional) Confirm `DEMO_GUIDE.md` is reproducible **FOR THE COMMONS GOOD**, right?

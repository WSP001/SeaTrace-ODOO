# SeaTrace-ODOO Public Functional Overview

## Purpose

SeaTrace-ODOO provides an open, modular backbone for fisheries and seafood supply chain participants who need verifiable product histories, operational integrity, and accountable data exchange across geographically distributed actors.

This public edition emphasizes:
- Transparent functional capabilities
- Sustainability alignment
- Open integration pathways
- Community and institutional collaboration potential

---

## Core Public Functions

| Pillar | Functional Focus (Public Scope) | Example Outcomes |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| **SeaSide (Hold)** | Vessel presence & activity logging (non-sensitive telemetry references) | Consistent trace start points |
| **DeckSide (Record)** | Catch event registration & formatting | Standardized batch/catch identity |
| **DockSide (Store)** | Storage lifecycle & handling state continuity | Integrity of custody transitions |
| **MarketSide (Exchange - public layer)** | Consumer transparency & QR provenance lookups | Trust reinforcement at point-of-choice |

> **Note:** MarketSide advanced trading, pricing logic, or proprietary optimization layers are intentionally excluded from public documentation.

---

## What SeaTrace-ODOO Enables (Public Layer)

### 1. Chain Continuity
- Each stage of product movement (vessel → handling → storage → presentation) retains a linked audit reference
- Reduces ambiguity in cross-border, multi-processor workflows

### 2. Structured Data Normalization
- Standard species, weight, temporal, and custody metadata formatting
- Facilitates alignment with import/export and sustainability reporting frameworks

### 3. Interoperability Bridges
- ODOO integration for general ledger alignment (cost buckets, movements, and batch ledger classification)
- API-first endpoints for external marketplace or regulatory viewers (read-only public contexts)

### 4. Consumer & Institutional Confidence
- QR-accessible provenance snapshots (non-sensitive fields only)
- Declarative sustainability assertions tied to recorded operational milestones

### 5. Operational Resilience (Public Framing)
- Modular pillar-based separation promotes fault isolation
- Each functional span (Hold/Record/Store/Exchange) can evolve independently under versioned schema stewardship

## Alignment with Fisheries Sector Needs

| Stakeholder Type | Public Value Received |
|------------------|----------------------|
| **Small Vessel Operators** | Lower barrier to structured digital logging |
| **Processors** | Unified handling + storage state continuity |
| **Certification Bodies** | Baseline trace event evidence chain |
| **Retail / Food Service** | Authenticity reinforcement at presentation layer |
| **NGOs / Observers** | Framework for standardized trace event evaluation |
| **Technology Partners** | Defined integration surface without needing private logic access |

---

## Sustainability & Accountability Contributions

- Supports trace-event immutability patterns (public layer references only)
- Encourages adoption of standardized reporting before advanced automation
- Establishes foundation for future compliance augmentation (e.g. SIMP, MSC alignment) without exposing proprietary compliance scoring implementations

---

## Open Integration Footprint

| Category | Public Specification Scope |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **API Access** | REST-style endpoints for non-sensitive vessel, batch, and storage queries |
| **Data Export** | Structured JSON schemas for downstream analytics |
| **ODOO Coupling** | Inventory movement & batch ledger reflection (abstracted) |
| **Extension Points** | Hook surfaces for adding formatting, enrichment, or anonymized metrics |

---

## Governance (Public Layer Statement)

- Public modules (SeaSide, DeckSide, DockSide) encourage ecosystem experimentation
- Public documentation defines consistent expectations for:
  - Schema evolution (version tagging)
  - Deprecation notices
  - Compatibility boundaries
- Private enhancements (e.g. advanced optimization or monetized modules) are intentionally omitted to preserve integrity and security segmentation

---

## Risk Mitigation (Public View)

| Area | Public Mitigation Principle |
|------|----------------------------|
| **Data Authenticity** | Event linkage & identity structuring |
| **Fragmentation** | Canonical schema adoption pathway |
| **Overexposure** | Sensitive business logic withheld from public layer |
| **Vendor Lock-In** | API-first, pluggable patterns encourage neutrality |
| **Compliance Drift** | Normalized base event model supports audit layering |

---

## Example Public Workflow

```
[Vessel Log Event] 
   → (SeaSide formats) 
      → [Catch Entry Registered] (DeckSide)
         → [Storage State Updates] (DockSide)
            → [QR Provenance Rendering] (MarketSide public lookup)
```

## Distinguishing Philosophy

SeaTrace-ODOO public layer:
- Focuses on clarity, repeatability, and trust scaffolding
- Avoids speculative claims; emphasizes what verifiably functions today
- Promotes a data hygiene foundation before advanced analytics or automation layers are introduced

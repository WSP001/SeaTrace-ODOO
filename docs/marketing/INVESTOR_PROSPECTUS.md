## The Problem: $150B Market in Crisis

### Industry Pain Points

**1. Fragmented Data Systems**
- Vessels, processors, storage, and retailers operate on disconnected systems
- Manual data entry causes 30-40% error rates in compliance reporting
- No real-time visibility across supply chain stages

**2. Compliance Burden**
- SIMP (Seafood Import Monitoring Program) requires extensive documentation
- EU IUU (Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated) fishing regulations
- MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) certification tracking
- **Cost:** $50,000-$200,000 annually per mid-size operation

**3. Financial Opacity**
- Operational costs disconnected from accounting systems
- Manual reconciliation between catch data and financial ledgers
- No real-time profitability visibility at vessel or batch level

**4. Consumer Trust Deficit**
- 30% of "sustainable" seafood claims are unverifiable
- Growing demand for blockchain-verified provenance
- Premium pricing (15-25%) for verified sustainable products

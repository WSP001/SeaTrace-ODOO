## What’s Already in the Repository

- **Documentation**
  - `docs/pillars/seaside.md`, `deckside.md`, `dockside.md`, `marketside.md`
  - `docs/CRYPTO_QUICK_START.md`, `PACKET_SWITCHING_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
    `PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
  - Security templates under `docs/security/` (SAN config, Netfirms ticket,
    Sectigo revocation, incident playbooks)
  - Coordination files: `READY_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_RUNS.md`,
    `GIT_COMMANDS_READY.md`, `DOCS_FIRST_PR_PLAN.md`
- **Automation / Tooling**
  - `.gitleaks-seatrace.toml` tuned for SeaTrace patterns
  - `.github/workflows/update-embeddings.yml` +
    `.github/scripts/create_embeddings.py`
  - `postman/collection.json` (four-pillar E2E skeleton)
  - `scripts/dev-quickstart.sh`, `scripts/create-pillars-md.sh`,
    `scripts/bashrc_roberto002`
  - `.ai/assistant_context.json` for IDE agents

These artifacts are staged and ready for a docs-first commit; no secrets or
private keys are present in the working tree.

## What the Team Still Has to Do

| Area            | Owner        | Outstanding Work                                                |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Secret hygiene  | Security/Ops | Run `gitleaks` scan, rotate TLS if required, post clearance     |
| Docs-first PR   | Dev Lead     | Create `feature/pillars-dev-quickstart`, commit, stop for review|
| Validation      | QA           | Execute Newman/k6 suites, confirm docs match behaviour          |
| Automation      | SRE          | Configure GitHub secrets, monitor embeddings workflow, smoke prod|
| Ownership       | Everyone     | Keep personal project files out of this repo (sirjames content) |

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Security/Ops** – follow `docs/TEAM_HANDOFF.md` Section 1, attach clearance.
2. **Dev Lead** – once cleared, run the prepared `git add/commit` block and send
   Roberto the `git show` output for approval.
3. **QA** – after the PR opens, run the Postman collection and record any gaps.
4. **SRE** – prepare the secret values and verify the embeddings workflow on the
   first merge to `main`.
5. **Workspace hygiene** – move any SirJames or Next.js assets into their
   dedicated repository before committing further SeaTrace work.

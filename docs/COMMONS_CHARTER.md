## Mission Statement

SeaTrace is committed to **keeping SeaSide, DeckSide, and DockSide free and accessible** as a **public good** for the global seafood supply chain. These pillars form the foundational infrastructure for vessel tracking, catch recording, and storage managementâ€”essential capabilities that should be available to all participants, from small-scale fishers to large enterprises.

**Our Promise:**
- SeaSide, DeckSide, and DockSide will **always remain free** (Public Unlimited License)
- No feature gates, no usage metering, no paywalls on public pillars
- Sustainable funding through MarketSide monetization and the Commons Fund
- Transparent governance with public accountability

## The Commons Model

### What's Free (Public Unlimited)

| Pillar | Capabilities | Access |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **SeaSide (HOLD)** | Vessel tracking, AIS integration, telemetry | âœ… Free Forever |
| **DeckSide (RECORD)** | Catch recording, verification, compliance | âœ… Free Forever |
| **DockSide (STORE)** | Storage management, chain-of-custody, inventory | âœ… Free Forever |

### What's Monetized (Private Limited)

| Pillar | Capabilities | Access |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **MarketSide (EXCHANGE)** | Trading, pricing algorithms, settlement, premium analytics | ðŸ’° Paid Subscription |

---

## Sustainability: The Commons Fund

### How Free Pillars Stay Free

**Cross-Subsidy Model:**
- 10-15% of MarketSide gross revenue is allocated to the **Commons Fund**
- Commons Fund covers infrastructure costs for SeaSide, DeckSide, and DockSide
- Monthly transparency reports published at `/api/commons/fund`

### Commons Fund Allocation

```
MarketSide Revenue (100%)
    â”œâ”€ Commons Fund (10-15%) â†’ Free Pillar Infrastructure
    â”œâ”€ R&D (20-25%) â†’ Platform improvements
    â”œâ”€ Operations (30-35%) â†’ Support, hosting, security
    â””â”€ Growth (30-40%) â†’ Sales, marketing, expansion
```

### Cost Controls (Not Paywalls)

To keep the commons sustainable without compromising "free":

**1. Concurrency Management**
- Heavy endpoints use priority queues (not rate limits)
- Sponsor credits enable higher priority (optional, not required)
- All requests eventually processâ€”no blocking

**2. Efficient Architecture**
- Direct-to-S3 presigned uploads (client â†’ S3 â†’ API metadata)
- Aggressive CDN caching for public reads
- Async pipelines for batch jobs
- Data compaction (S3 â†’ Glacier lifecycle)

**3. Fair Use Scheduling**
- Large batch jobs queued during off-peak hours
- `X-Queue-Position` header shows status
- First-come, first-served (no pay-to-skip)

**Framing:** *"Public Unlimited means we don't meter you or charge you; we just schedule heavy work so the commons stays healthy."*

## Transparency & Accountability

### Monthly Commons Fund Report

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/commons/fund`

**Response Schema:**
```json
{
  "period": "2025-09",

  "commons_allocation_percent": 12.5,
  "commons_fund_total": 15625.00,
  "expenses": {
    "seaside_infrastructure": 3200.00,
    "deckside_infrastructure": 5800.00,
    "dockside_infrastructure": 4100.00,

## Governance Principles

### 1. No Retroactive Paywalls

**Promise:** We will **never** move existing free endpoints behind paywalls.

**Process for Changes:**
- 90-day public notice for any scope changes
- Community feedback period
- Grandfather existing integrations

### 2. Sponsor Credits (Optional Enhancement)

**What They Are:**
- Optional priority credits for heavy workloads
- Funded by NGOs, foundations, or regional programs
- **Not required** for basic access

**PUL Token with Sponsor Credits:**
```json
{
  "typ": "PUL",
  "priority": "sponsor",
  "credits": {
    "deckside_batch_mb": 50000,
    "dockside_checks": 20000
  }
}
```

**When Credits Run Out:**
- Requests still process (no blocking)
- Lower priority queue (fair scheduling)
- No feature loss

### 3. Support Services (Separate from Software)

**Free Software, Paid Services:**
- Managed hosting
- Incident response
- Schema change assistance
- Custom dashboards
- Training and onboarding

**Model:** Classic "open core services" without touching free features

### 4. Compliance Add-Ons (Configuration, Not Features)

**Free:**
- GDST/MSC schemas
- Basic compliance checks
- Standard reporting

**Paid (Optional):**
- Regulator-ready report bundles
- Jurisdiction-specific mappings
- Notarized exports
- Audit trail packages

**Principle:** Ships as configuration + reports, not features, so PUL promise holds

## Financial Sustainability

### Unit Economics

**Free Pillar Cost Drivers:**
- Storage: $0.023/GB/month (S3 Standard â†’ Glacier)
- Database: $0.10/GB/month (indexed metadata only)
- Bandwidth: $0.09/GB (CDN-cached, minimal origin egress)
- Compute: $0.05/hour (async pipelines, auto-scaling)

**Cost Controls:**
- Presigned uploads â†’ 90% reduction in API bandwidth
- Aggressive caching â†’ 95% cache hit rate
- Data compaction â†’ 70% storage savings
- Concurrency limits â†’ predictable compute costs

**Revenue Drivers:**
- PL subscriptions: $500-$5,000/month per customer
- Overage billing: $0.01-$0.05 per unit
- Support retainers: $1,000-$10,000/month
- Compliance add-ons: $500-$2,000 one-time

**Break-Even:** 50 PL customers cover free pillar OPEX for 10,000 free users

### Bridge Funding

**Early Stage:**
- Sponsor credits from NGOs/foundations
- Grants for public infrastructure
- ESG-focused investors

**Growth Stage:**
- MarketSide revenue scales

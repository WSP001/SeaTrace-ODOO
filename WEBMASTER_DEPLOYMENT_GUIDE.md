## ✅ **VERIFICATION AFTER DEPLOYMENT**

### 1. Check Performance Banner

**Open URL:** https://seatrace.worldseafoodproducers.com

**Expected to See:**
```
⚡ Higher Performance Architecture

┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
│   99.9%    │    94%     │   112%     │   <10s     │
│  Faster    │    ER      │  Commons   │    API     │
│Verification│  Coverage  │    Fund    │  Response  │
└────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘
```

### 2. Check Four Pillars Cards

**Each pillar should show:**

**🌊 SeaSide (HOLD)**
```
📦 Model: PublicVesselPacket
🔗 Output: PING-{vessel_id} (F/V 000-137)
```

**📊 DeckSide (RECORD)**
```
📦 Model: PublicCatchPacket
🔗 Output: CATCH-{trip_id} (4,140 trips)
```

**🐟 DockSide (STORE)**
```
📦 Model: PublicLotPacket
🔗 Output: LOT-{lot_number} (BBSS format)
```

**🏪 MarketSide (EXCHANGE)**
```
📦 Model: PublicVerificationPacket
🔗 Output: VERIFY-{id} (<10s response)
```

### 3. Test Responsive Design

**Desktop (1200px+):** 4 metric cards in a row  
**Tablet (768px):** 2 metric cards per row  
**Mobile (480px):** 1 metric card per row (stacked)

### 4. Test All Links

- [ ] "Four Pillars" anchor link scrolls to pillars section
- [ ] "API Docs" anchor link scrolls to docs section
- [ ] "Postman" link downloads collection
- [ ] "Main Site" link goes to worldseafoodproducers.com
- [ ] Each "Test [Pillar] API" button goes to correct pillar page

### 5. Check Browser Console

**Press F12 → Console Tab**

**Should see:** No errors  
**Should NOT see:** Failed to load resources, 404 errors, JavaScript errors

---

## 🎯 **WHAT CHANGED (FOR WEBMASTER NOTES)**

### Added Performance Banner

**Location:** Between hero section and Four Pillars section

**Purpose:** Shows quantified HIGHER PERFORMANCE improvements to investors

**Metrics:**
- 99.9% Faster Verification (3-5 days → <10 seconds)
- 94% ER Coverage (4,140 trips tracked)
- 112% Commons Fund (self-sustaining model)
- <10s API Response (Ed25519 signatures)

### Added Model References to Pillar Cards

**Location:** Inside each of the 4 pillar cards

**Purpose:** Shows which PUBLIC model each microservice uses

**Format:**
```html
<div style="background:#071a38;border-radius:8px;padding:8px;margin:8px 0">
  📦 Model: <code>Public[X]Packet</code><br>
  🔗 Output: [PACKET-TYPE]-{id} (details)
</div>
```

---

## 📊 **WHAT INVESTORS WILL SEE**

### Landing Experience

1. **Immediate Impact:** Stack Operator Valuation: $4.2M USD
2. **Performance Proof:** 4 quantified metrics above the fold
3. **Architecture Clarity:** Each pillar shows its public model
4. **Data Scale:** 138 vessels, 4,140 trips tracked
5. **API Access:** Test endpoints for all 4 pillars

### Investor Value Proposition

**99.9% Faster = Real-time transparency**  
Traditional systems take 3-5 days to verify seafood origin. SeaTrace does it in <10 seconds with Ed25519 signatures.

**94% ER Coverage = NOAA compliance**  
Legacy systems achieve 40-50%. SeaTrace automates the burden to reach 94% across 4,140 trips.

**112% Commons Fund = Self-sustaining**  
No VC funding required. The model generates surplus at $18.50/tonne for ecosystem improvements.

**<10s API Response = Consumer trust**  
Every QR verification happens in real-time with cryptographic proof.

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Problem: FTP Connection Refused

**Causes:**
- Netfirms server maintenance
- Incorrect hostname
- Firewall blocking port 21

**Solutions:**
1. Verify hostname: ftp.worldseafoodproducers.com
2. Check Netfirms control panel for server status
3. Try from different network (disable VPN if active)
4. Contact Netfirms support if persistent

### Problem: File Upload Fails

**Causes:**
- File size too large (unlikely for 8KB HTML)
- Disk quota exceeded
- Permission issues on /seatrace/ directory

**Solutions:**
1. Check file size: Should be ~8-9 KB
2. Verify disk quota in Netfirms control panel
3. Ensure /seatrace/ directory exists and is writable
4. Try uploading to root first, then move to /seatrace/

### Problem: Website Shows Old Version

**Causes:**
- Browser cache
- CDN cache (if Netfirms uses CDN)
- Upload went to wrong directory

**Solutions:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify file path on server: /seatrace/index.html
4. Check file timestamp on server (should be recent)
5. Try incognito/private browsing mode

### Problem: Performance Banner Not Showing

**Causes:**
- CSS inline styles blocked
- JavaScript error preventing render
- File uploaded but incomplete

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify file size matches local file
3. Re-upload if file size differs
4. Clear browser cache and hard refresh

### Problem: Links Not Working

**Causes:**
- Relative paths incorrect
- Files not uploaded yet (pillars/, spec/, etc.)
- Server configuration issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify /seatrace/pillars/ directory exists
2. Upload pillar HTML files if missing
3. Check links in browser dev tools (F12 → Network tab)
4. Update links to absolute paths if needed

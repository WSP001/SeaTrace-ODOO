## 📋 COPY THESE EXACT COMMANDS (Real Examples)

### Example 1: Check Where You Are Right Now

```powershell
project-context
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Active Project: SeaTraceProduction
Project Path: C:\Users\Roberto002\Documents\GitHub\SeaTrace-ODOO
Context: worldseafoodproducers.com, Commons Charter, PUL licensing
Git: Branch main, Working tree clean
```

---

### Example 2: Work on PUBLIC Commons Charter

```powershell
# 1. Make sure you're in PUBLIC repo
cd-seatrace-prod

# 2. Verify context
project-context

# 3. Open the Commons Charter
code docs\COMMONS_CHARTER.md

# 4. Ask Copilot for help
# Say: "Help me add a section about seafood data governance to the Commons Charter"
# Copilot will see: $env:ACTIVE_PROJECT_CONTEXT = "SeaTraceProduction"
# Copilot will know: This is PUBLIC repo, focus on Commons

# 5. Check git status
git status

# 6. Commit your changes
git add docs\COMMONS_CHARTER.md
git commit -m "docs: add data governance section to Commons Charter"
git push origin main
```

---

### Example 3: Switch to PRIVATE Repo (SeaTrace003)

```powershell
# 1. Switch to private repo
cd-seatrace003

# 2. Verify you switched
project-context

# 3. Now you can work on EMR/enterprise features
# Say: "Help me add a new enterprise pricing tier"
# Copilot will see: $env:ACTIVE_PROJECT_CONTEXT = "SeaTrace003"
# Copilot will know: This is PRIVATE repo, EMR features are okay

# 4. Switch back to PUBLIC when done
cd-seatrace-prod
```

---

### Example 4: Switch to Sir James Educational Project

```powershell
# 1. Switch to Sir James
cd-sirjames

# 2. Verify context
project-context

# 3. Work on educational content
# Say: "Help me create a new chapter for the adventure"
# Copilot will see: $env:ACTIVE_PROJECT_CONTEXT = "SirJames"

# 4. Return to SeaTrace PUBLIC
cd-seatrace-prod
```

---

### Example 5: Open Projects in VS Code

```powershell
# Open SeaTrace PUBLIC in VS Code
seatrace-prod-code

# Open SeaTrace003 PRIVATE in VS Code
seatrace003-code

# Open Sir James in VS Code
sirjames-code
```

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES & FIXES

### ❌ Mistake 1: Pasting Commands Multiple Times

**What Happened (from your terminal):**
```powershell
& "...\DevShell.ps1" -Project SeaTraceProduction& "...\DevShell.ps1" -Project SeaTraceProduction& "...\DevShell.ps1" -Project SeaTraceProduction
```

**Error:**
```
ParserError: Unexpected token '-Project' in expression or statement.
```

**Why:** You pasted the command 4 times without pressing Enter between them.

**Fix:** Copy the command ONCE, paste it ONCE, press Enter ONCE.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Aliases Not Found

**Error:**
```
cd-seatrace-prod: The term is not recognized
```

**Why:** DevShell.ps1 hasn't been loaded in THIS terminal session.

**Fix:** Run the DevShell.ps1 command first:
```powershell
& "C:\Users\Roberto002\OneDrive\Sir James\LOGIC SirJames_Interactive_Prototype_With_Chapter10\scripts\DevShell.ps1" -Project SeaTraceProduction
```

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Copying Example Text Instead of Running Commands

**What You Did (from your terminal):**
```powershell
"SirJames" { "[📚 Sir James]" }
"SeaTraceProduction" { "[🌊 SeaTrace-PUBLIC]" }
```

**Error:**
```
ParserError: Unexpected token '{' in expression or statement.
```

**Why:** That's example text showing what the PROMPT will look like. It's not a command to run.

**Fix:** Don't copy that. Just run DevShell.ps1, and your prompt will change automatically.

---

## 🎯 HOW TO TELL COPILOT YOUR CONTEXT

### ✅ Good Copilot Requests (Clear Context)

**For PUBLIC Work:**
```
"I'm working on SeaTrace-ODOO (PUBLIC repo).
Help me update docs/COMMONS_CHARTER.md to add a section about 
data sharing governance for seafood traceability."
```

**For PRIVATE Work:**
```
"I'm working on SeaTrace003 (PRIVATE repo).
Help me add a new enterprise pricing tier for hospitals with 500+ beds
in src/marketside/licensing/entitlements.py"
```

**For Sir James:**
```
"I'm working on Sir James educational project.
Help me create a new chapter about maritime navigation."
```

---

### ❌ Bad Copilot Requests (Vague)

```
❌ "Help me update the file"
   (Which file? Which project?)

❌ "Add a new feature"
   (What feature? Which repo?)

❌ "Fix the code"
   (What code? Where?)
```

---

## 🔍 VERIFY YOUR CONTEXT BEFORE ASKING COPILOT

### Step 1: Check Where You Are
```powershell
project-context
```

### Step 2: Check Git Status
```powershell
git status
git branch --show-current
```

### Step 3: Verify Repository
```powershell
git remote get-url origin
```

### Step 4: Now Ask Copilot
```
"I'm in [PROJECT NAME from project-context].
 Current branch: [BRANCH from git branch].
 Help me [SPECIFIC TASK]."
```

## 🎓 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Do This Now):
1. ✅ Keep your terminal open (DevShell is loaded!)
2. ✅ Try running: `project-context`
3. ✅ Try switching repos: `cd-seatrace003` then `cd-seatrace-prod`
4. ✅ Practice telling Copilot your context

### Short-term (This Week):
1. Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to understand scope
2. Review `DEVSHELL_ENGINEERING_PLAN.md` for improvements
3. Practice the workflow checklist above
4. Create similar files for SeaTrace003 (PRIVATE repo)

### Long-term (Next Steps):
1. Implement `.copilot-context.json` auto-generation
2. Add git branch to your prompt
3. Create pre-commit hooks for context validation
4. Document your workflow patterns

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM YOUR TERMINAL SESSION

### What Worked:
✅ DevShell.ps1 loaded successfully  
✅ Changed to correct directory automatically  
✅ All aliases became available  
✅ Environment variables set correctly  
✅ Modules loaded (ThreadJob, PSReadLine, PlatyPS)  

### What Needs Improvement:
⚠️ You're pasting commands multiple times (causes parser errors)  
⚠️ You're copying example text as commands (causes syntax errors)  
⚠️ Need to verify context before asking Copilot  

### Best Practice:
1. **ONE command at a time**
2. **Press Enter ONCE**
3. **Wait for prompt**
4. **Verify with project-context**
5. **THEN ask Copilot**
